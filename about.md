title:  About me
---

My name is Erik Schierboom and I'm a software developer from The Netherlands. Writing software is probably my greatest passion! I have written software in many languages, but I'm particularly fond of C#. Most applications I have written were web applications, though I have also created mobile apps.

Besides writing software, I try to help others by posting on [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/2071395/erik-schierboom), creating [demo applications and libraries](https://github.com/ErikSchierboom/) and writing [blog posts](/posts-by-date/).

### Work

For my day-time job I work at the [Radboud University](http://www.ru.nl/isc). In my off-work hours I work on a website for movie enthusiasts, [iCheckMovies.com](http://www.icheckmovies.com), together with two friends of mine. If you want to know more about my professional career, please visit my [LinkedIn page](http://nl.linkedin.com/in/erikschierboom).

### Hobbies

When I am not programming, you can find me doing some good-old book reading, watching a movie, listening to some music or playing on the guitar.
