Over the years I have worked on lots of software projects, such as:

### Websites

- [iCheckMovies](http://www.icheckmovies.com): a website that allows people to keep track of what movies they have seen.

- [QOAM](https://www.qoam.eu): a website for journal authors who want to find good open access journals.

### Apps

- [Address book app](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/adresboek/id624561801?mt=8): an iOS and Android application to access the public contact data of Radboud University employees.

- [PV Discount app](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/korting-pv-radboud/id748048429?mt=8): an iOS and Android application to allow PV Radboud members to see at which companies they can get a discount.

### Libraries

- [MoviePosterDB library](https://github.com/studio-donder/MoviePosterDb): a library to access the movie poster DB API.

- [JSON.NET custom contract resolver](https://github.com/ErikSchierboom/JsonDotNetCustomContractResolvers): a custom contract resolver for JSON.NET to control what properties get serialized.

### Tools

- [MPWinamp](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mpwinamp/): a plug-in to allow automatic updating of your MSN nickname based on what song was playing in Winamp.<br/>
Disclaimer: my first public source code, so please don't judge my coding skills by this code :)

### Demo applications

- [Client-side globalization](https://github.com/ErikSchierboom/clientsideglobalization): shows how to do globalization on the client.

- [Custom OAuth client](https://github.com/ErikSchierboom/CustomOAuthClient): explains how to create a custom OAuth client for use in ASP.NET websites.

### Open-source

I try to open-source as much of my code as possible. If you want to see more, please visit my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/ErikSchierboom) or [Studio Donder's GitHub profile](https://github.com/studio-donder/).
